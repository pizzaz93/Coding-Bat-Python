Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, 
if any of the values is a teen -- in the range 13..19 inclusive
-- then that value counts as 0, except 15 and 16 do not count as a teens.
Write a separate helper "def fix_teen(n):"that takes in an int value and
returns that value fixed for the teen rule. In this way, you avoid repeating
the teen code 3 times (i.e. "decomposition").
